      2. **Server-side state via ``runs.get``** — invoked after the stream
         closes (cleanly or with exception) to verify the run is actually
         done. Required because SSE long-poll can close on HTTP keep-alive
         timeout while the run is still running, which would otherwise be
         misread as ``"success"`` (observed in production with long-running
         literature search tasks under concurrency).

         the run is alive but we lost the stream; re-join up to
         ``_MAX_RECONNECT_ATTEMPTS`` times before giving up.

    The previous implementation trusted clean stream exits as success
    without any verification, which produced false-positive notifications
    when SSE keep-alive timeouts closed the stream early.

    Race-safety note: ``runs.get`` returning ``"error"`` immediately after
    a clean stream close can be a transient state for an actually-successful
    run (server hasn't finalized the writeback). We trust the absence of
    in-band error event over a stale ``runs.get="error"`` — see the
