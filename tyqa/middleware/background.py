"""``BackgroundExecutionMiddleware`` — background-process tools for the main agent.

Mirrors deepagents' ``AsyncSubAgentMiddleware`` shape (a middleware that owns a set of
tools). The tools are stateless wrappers over :mod:`tyqa.background`, which holds
the live, process-level registry. They reuse the sandbox's ``validate_command`` so a
background launch cannot bypass the same safety checks as ``execute``.

Naming: these manage OS *processes* (never "job" — that word is reserved-free; async
sub-agents are *tasks*, future cron is *schedules*).
