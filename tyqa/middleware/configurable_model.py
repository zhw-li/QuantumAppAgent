"""Middleware that resolves the chat model from RunnableConfig.configurable per call.

The deployed async sub-agents run in a separate ``langgraph dev`` subprocess
and have their model frozen into the compiled graph at subprocess boot time
(see ``tyqa/subagents/_factory.py``). When the user runs ``/model``
in the CLI, only the CLI process's model state changes — the subprocess
graph still uses the boot-time model.

This middleware closes that gap by reading ``model`` / ``model_provider``
from ``RunnableConfig.configurable`` on every model call. The CLI's patched
``start_async_task`` / ``update_async_task`` (see ``llm/patches.py``) injects
those fields into ``client.runs.create(config=...)``; the deployed graph
hits this middleware and re-resolves the chat model fresh.

When ``configurable.model`` is absent, the middleware is a pass-through —
safe to install on the CLI's in-process agent too.

The middleware mirrors the pattern used by ``ModelFallbackMiddleware``:
``request.override(model=new_model)`` does not break tool binding, because
the downstream model-invocation node re-binds tools per request.

**Reading the config**: ``Runtime`` (per its own docstring) does NOT include
``config``. The official path to reach ``RunnableConfig`` from inside any
runnable context (including middleware) is ``langgraph.config.get_config()``,
which reads a context-var that LangGraph populates per node execution. That
is what this middleware uses. ``request.runtime`` is intentionally NOT
relied upon for config — only for diagnostics.

    identical models within a turn. The cache is a plain dict guarded by a
