"""CodeInterpreterMiddleware configuration for tyqa.

Wraps ``langchain-quickjs``'s ``CodeInterpreterMiddleware`` with project-specific
defaults: a PTC allowlist scoped to read-only, batch-friendly tools relevant to
the scientific research workflow (search, sub-agent dispatch, file inspection),
a longer per-eval timeout suitable for LLM-authored algorithms, a larger result
budget for returning structured JSON, and a user-facing tool name that LLMs
recognize from ChatGPT Code Interpreter training data.

Excluded from PTC by design:
    - ``task`` (sub-agent dispatch) — reserved by langchain-quickjs >=0.3; it
      is always the top-level ``task()`` REPL global (with ``responseSchema``),
      so a ``tools.task`` variant would be a conflicting, degraded duplicate
    - ``execute`` (shell) — would bypass ``HumanInTheLoopMiddleware`` approval
    - ``write_file`` / ``edit_file`` — side-effectful, no batch benefit
    - ``think_tool`` — reflection is not batchable
    - ``tavily_search`` — only mounted on the ``research-agent`` sub-agent,
      not on the main agent; main agent reaches search via ``task`` dispatch
    - MCP tools — dynamic at runtime; add manually if a specific server needs PTC

Usage::

    from tyqa.middleware import create_code_interpreter_middleware

    middleware = create_code_interpreter_middleware(
        timeout=60.0, max_result_chars=10000
    )

        timeout: Per-eval timeout in seconds. Defaults to 60s — long enough
            for LLM-authored algorithms that touch async sub-agent dispatch
            (``start_async_task`` + ``check_async_task`` polling).
        max_result_chars: Maximum characters of JS eval output passed back
            to the LLM. Defaults to 10k — fits structured JSON aggregations
            of file reads / sub-agent results without truncating useful
            payloads. Larger values trade tokens for completeness.

    Returns:
        Configured ``CodeInterpreterMiddleware`` ready to append to an agent's
        middleware stack.
