# Expanded Review Checklist

This is an expanded version of the 5-aspect checklist from SKILL.md with additional detail and reviewer-perspective questions.

## Quick Review vs Full Review

**Quick Review (~15 min)**: Check only items marked with **(Q)** below — these are the highest-risk items that catch the most common rejection reasons.

**Full Review (~60+ min)**: Work through every item in all five aspects. Use this before final submission.

## Aspect 1: Contribution Sufficiency

> Core question: Does this paper give readers new knowledge?
> Core question: Does this paper provide readers with new knowledge?

### Novelty Assessment

- [ ] **(Q)** Is the core idea genuinely new, or a straightforward combination of existing ideas?
- [ ] If building on prior work, is the extension significant enough?
- [ ] Could a domain expert have easily arrived at this solution?
- [ ] Does the paper provide a new insight or understanding, not just a new method?

### Failure Case Analysis

- [ ] Are the paper's failure cases common in practice?
- [ ] Would the target audience frequently encounter scenarios where this method fails?
- [ ] Are failure cases honestly discussed?

### Technique Maturity

- [ ] Has the core technique been extensively studied before?
- [ ] If the technique is known, does the paper provide a new perspective or significant improvement?
- [ ] Is the improvement surprising or was it predictable?

### Contribution Scope

- [ ] Are the claimed contributions consistent with what the paper actually delivers?
- [ ] Is each contribution verifiable from the paper content?
- [ ] Does each contribution provide concrete technical value (not just "we propose...")?

## Aspect 2: Writing Clarity

> Core question: Can a reader understand and reproduce the method?

### Reproducibility

- [ ] **(Q)** Are all model architectures specified (layers, dimensions, activation functions)?
- [ ] Are training details provided (optimizer, learning rate, batch size, epochs)?
- [ ] Are data preprocessing steps described?
- [ ] Are evaluation protocols clearly defined?
- [ ] Would code release be necessary for reproducibility? If so, is it planned?

### Method Clarity

- [ ] **(Q)** Does every method module have a clear motivation paragraph?
- [ ] Is the forward process (input → steps → output) described for each module?
- [ ] Are technical advantages of each design choice explained?
- [ ] Is the method overview clear (setting → core contribution → section roadmap)?

### Structural Clarity

- [ ] Does each paragraph convey exactly one message?
- [ ] Does each paragraph's first sentence state its topic?
- [ ] Is the flow between paragraphs logical?
- [ ] Is the flow between sections smooth?
- [ ] Are transitions between ideas explicit?

### Language Quality

- [ ] Is terminology consistent throughout the paper?
- [ ] Are all symbols/notations defined before use?
- [ ] Is the writing concise (no unnecessary verbosity)?
- [ ] Are sentences grammatically correct?

## Aspect 3: Experimental Results Quality

> Core question: Are the results convincing?

### Quantitative Results

- [ ] **(Q)** Is the improvement over baselines significant (not within noise)?
- [ ] Are standard deviations or confidence intervals provided?
- [ ] Is the absolute performance level acceptable for the application?
- [ ] Do results hold across all datasets, or only on specific ones?

### Qualitative Results

- [ ] Are visual comparisons provided alongside tables?
- [ ] Are improvements visible in qualitative results?
- [ ] Are failure cases shown (builds trust)?
- [ ] Is the visual quality of result figures professional?

### Efficiency

- [ ] Is computational cost compared (runtime, FLOPs, memory)?
- [ ] Is the trade-off between quality and efficiency discussed?
- [ ] Are practical requirements (GPU memory, training time) reported?

---

## Aspect 4: Experimental Testing Completeness

> Core question: Are all claims tested?

### Ablation Completeness

- [ ] **(Q)** Is every claimed contribution ablated in an experiment?
- [ ] Is there a comprehensive ablation table (full model vs. removing each component)?
- [ ] Are there focused tables for design choices and hyperparameters?
- [ ] Do ablation results match the paper's claims about each component?

### Baseline Completeness

- [ ] **(Q)** Are current SOTA methods included as baselines?
- [ ] Are recent methods from the last 2-3 years included?
- [ ] Are classic/foundational methods included?
- [ ] Is the comparison fair (same data, metrics, protocol)?

### Metric Completeness

- [ ] Are all standard metrics for this task reported?
- [ ] Are metrics appropriate for what the paper claims to improve?
- [ ] Are user studies included (if applicable)?

### Dataset Coverage

- [ ] Are standard benchmarks used for comparability?
- [ ] Are challenging/diverse datasets included?
- [ ] Do datasets truly test the method's strengths and reveal its weaknesses?

---

## Aspect 5: Method Design

> Core question: Is the method sound?

### Setting Validity

- [ ] **(Q)** Are the assumptions realistic?
- [ ] Is the input data available in practice?
- [ ] Is the computational requirement practical?
- [ ] Would users actually use this method as described?

### Technical Soundness

- [ ] Is the method theoretically motivated (not just empirically)?
- [ ] Are there known failure modes? Are they addressed?
- [ ] Does the method handle edge cases gracefully?

### Robustness

- [ ] Does the method work with default hyperparameters across scenes/cases?
- [ ] Is per-scene tuning required? (Major weakness if so)
- [ ] How sensitive is the method to input quality?
- [ ] Is the method stable during training?

### Benefit vs. Cost

- [ ] **(Q)** Do the benefits of new modules outweigh the limitations they introduce?
- [ ] Is the added complexity justified by the improvement?
- [ ] Are there simpler alternatives that achieve similar results?

## Reviewer Perspective Questions

As a reviewer, consider these overarching questions:

1. **Significance**: Would this paper change how people in the field think or work?
2. **Novelty**: Is the core idea new and non-obvious?
3. **Soundness**: Is the method technically sound and well-evaluated?
4. **Clarity**: Is the paper well-written and easy to follow?
5. **Completeness**: Are the experiments comprehensive?
6. **Limitations**: Are limitations honestly discussed?
7. **Reproducibility**: Could I reproduce the results from the paper alone?
