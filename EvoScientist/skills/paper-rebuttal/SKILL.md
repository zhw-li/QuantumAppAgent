# Paper Rebuttal

A systematic approach to writing rebuttals after receiving peer review feedback. The goal is not to defend every point — it's to move scores by addressing the concerns that actually drive them.

## When to Use This Skill

- User received reviewer comments and needs to write a rebuttal
- User asks how to respond to specific reviewer criticism
- User wants to analyze reviews strategically before responding
- User mentions "rebuttal", "reviewer comments", "review feedback", "respond to reviewers"
- User needs to respond to quantum application PoC concerns such as missing baselines, unsupported cloud/hardware claims, weak validation, or incomplete handoff evidence

> For pre-submission self-review and catching weaknesses before they become reviewer complaints, use the `paper-review` skill.

## When NOT to Use

- **Pre-submission or pre-handoff self-review** -> use `paper-review`.
- **Generating missing experiments, baselines, or app evidence** -> use `experiment-pipeline`.
- **Writing the original delivery package** -> use `paper-writing`.

## Step 1: Diagnose Reviews

Before writing a single word, answer: **"Why did this reviewer give this exact score?"** Not what they wrote — what drove the score. Most researchers skip this and address every comment equally. That is a mistake.

### Score Diagnosis

For each reviewer, ask: "What would move this reviewer from their current score to acceptance?"

| Score Range | Typical Situation | Your Strategy |
|-------------|------------------|---------------|
| 7+ | Already your champion | Arm them with ammunition for the discussion phase |
| 5-6 | On the fence, 1-2 concerns holding them back | Identify and resolve those specific concerns |
| 3-4 | Fundamental objection | Determine if the objection is addressable; if not, focus elsewhere |

### Color-Code Every Comment

Read through each review and mark every comment:

| Color | Meaning | Action | Budget |
|-------|---------|--------|--------|
| **Red** | Score-driving concern — this is why the score is low | Address first, maximum effort and evidence | 60% |
| **Orange** | Addressable concern — can be resolved | Respond with concrete data or revision | 30% |
| **Gray** | Minor or cosmetic | Acknowledge briefly, confirm fix | 10% |
| **Green** | Positive comment or praise | Note as ammunition for your champion | — |

### Identify the Invisible Question

Behind every reviewer comment is an unspoken question. A comment like "The baselines are outdated" really asks: "Is this method actually competitive with current approaches?" Address the invisible question, not just the surface request.

## Step 2: Plan Response Strategy

### Categorize Every Concern

| Category | Response Strategy |
|----------|-----------------|
| **Misunderstanding** | Clarify with specific references to the paper; restate the key point |
| **Missing experiment** | Provide the experiment inline if feasible; otherwise explain constraints honestly |
| **Missing baseline** | Add comparison or explain precisely why the baseline is not applicable |
| **Writing clarity** | Acknowledge and provide revised text in the rebuttal |
| **Fundamental concern** | Address directly with technical arguments AND additional evidence |
| **Minor issue** | Thank the reviewer and confirm the fix |

### Identify Common Themes

If multiple reviewers raise the same concern, it's almost certainly a real weakness. Consolidate these into a "Common Response" section — this saves word count and demonstrates that you understand the pattern.

### Distinguish Actionable vs. Subjective

- **Actionable**: "Missing comparison with Method X" — you can do this
- **Subjective**: "The novelty is limited" — harder to address, but can be reframed with evidence

### The Champion Strategy

**Your rebuttal's real audience is not the negative reviewer — it's the positive one.**

Your champion argues on your behalf in the AC discussion, often using your exact words. Write your rebuttal to arm them:

1. Make key arguments **copy-pasteable** — your champion will quote you directly
2. Highlight where reviewers **agree with each other** — consensus strengthens the champion's position
3. Flag **contradictions between reviewers** — if R1 says "limited novelty" but R2 says "interesting approach," your champion can use this
4. Lead with **strengths before weaknesses** — remind the AC what your paper does well

See [references/rebuttal-tactics.md](references/rebuttal-tactics.md) for the full 18 tactical rules.

## Step 3: Write the Rebuttal

### Structure

1. **Opening**: One line thanking reviewers (keep it short)
2. **Common concerns**: Address issues raised by multiple reviewers first — these are highest priority
3. **Per-reviewer responses**: Address remaining concerns in priority order (red → orange → gray), NOT in the order the reviewer wrote them

### Per-Concern Format

For each concern, follow this three-part structure:

1. **Acknowledge**: Show you understand the concern (one sentence)
2. **Respond**: Provide your answer — evidence, clarification, new experiment results
3. **Action**: State what you changed in the revision (specific section/table/figure)

Use a fillable template at [assets/rebuttal-template.md](assets/rebuttal-template.md).

### The Neutral Third-Party Test

Before submitting, have someone who hasn't read your paper read only the reviews and your rebuttal. Ask: "Can you tell whether the concerns were addressed?" If not, rewrite.

## Counterintuitive Rebuttal Principles

1. **Submit a rebuttal even with extreme scores.** A paper with scores of 3/8/8 has better odds than you think. The negative reviewer may realize they are an outlier during discussion. But only if you submit a rebuttal — without one, the AC has nothing to work with.

2. **Concede something small, win something big.** Acknowledging a minor weakness ("We agree that Table 2 could include dataset X for completeness") makes your defense of major points more credible. Pure defense with zero concession reads as unobjective.

3. **One new experiment beats three paragraphs of explanation.** Reviewers are trained to be skeptical of arguments. They are not trained to be skeptical of data. A small new experiment that directly addresses a concern is worth more than any amount of reasoning.

4. **The best rebuttal is written before submission.** Draft responses to likely attacks while writing the paper ("prebuttal"). Two benefits: you often realize the attack is valid and fix the paper, and if the attack comes, you have a polished response ready.

5. **Don't defend every point equally.** Equal effort signals you don't know which points matter. Allocate your word budget according to the color-coding: 60% red, 30% orange, 10% gray. Reviewers notice when you nail the big issues.

## Common Reviewer Concerns

Prepare responses for these frequent concerns. Having a prepared response doesn't mean copying it verbatim — adapt to your specific paper and the reviewer's specific framing.

| Common Concern | Response Strategy |
|---------------|-------------------|
| "Limited novelty" | Articulate the specific insight; show what prior work cannot do; narrow and sharpen the claim |
| "Marginal improvement" | Emphasize other advantages (speed, generalizability, simplicity); add challenging test cases |
| "Missing ablations" | Provide the ablation table inline in the rebuttal |
| "Missing baselines" | Add the comparison or explain precisely why it's not applicable |
| "Not reproducible" | Add implementation details; commit to code release with a specific timeline |
| "Limited evaluation" | Add diverse datasets or metrics; if infeasible, explain resource constraints honestly |
| "No limitation discussed" | Add a limitation section in the revision; acknowledge this was an oversight |
| "Overclaimed results" | Weaken specific claims to match evidence; show the revised wording |
| "Unfair comparison" | Use standard evaluation protocols; add commonly reported baselines |
| "Method is engineering, not research" | Identify the scientific insight behind the design; explain why the choice is non-obvious |
| "Metrics don't match claims" | Align each claim with a specific metric; add the missing metric if feasible |
| "Related work incomplete" | Add the missing references; explain the relationship to your work |

> **Need to run new experiments for the rebuttal?** Use the `experiment-craft` skill for targeted debugging, or `experiment-pipeline` for a full new experiment stage.

## Handoff from Paper Review

This skill picks up where `paper-review` leaves off. If you used `paper-review` before submission, these artifacts are especially useful for rebuttal:

| Artifact from paper-review | How It Helps Rebuttal |
|---------------------------|----------------------|
| Reject-first simulation | You've already anticipated likely attacks |
| Claim-evidence audit table | Quickly verify whether a reviewer's concern about unsupported claims is valid |
| Prebuttal drafts (Phase 6) | Ready-made response templates for common criticisms |
| Trust scorecard | Identifies weaknesses you can proactively concede |
