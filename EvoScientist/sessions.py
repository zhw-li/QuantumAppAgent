"""Session persistence using LangGraph's SQLite checkpoint storage.

Provides thread CRUD operations, prefix-matched resume, and an async
context manager for the shared ``AsyncSqliteSaver`` checkpointer.

Adapted from upstream ``deepagents_cli/sessions.py``.

Per-step pruning:
    LangGraph's checkpointer writes a full state snapshot per super-step,
    causing unbounded growth (multi-GB sessions.db). EvoScientist never
    reads historical checkpoints — resume always reads the latest, HITL
    interrupts attach pending writes to the just-written row. So
    ``get_checkpointer()`` yields a ``PruningCheckpointer`` that prunes
    older rows for the same ``(thread_id, checkpoint_ns)`` after every
    ``aput()``. The first-run migration sweep cleans up legacy bloat.

    The upstream reducer lives in ``deepagents._messages_reducer`` (a
    private module) and itself adapts langgraph's experimental
    ``_messages_delta_reducer`` (PR #7729). Both surfaces are
    pre-stable — langgraph marks DeltaChannel as Beta, and the deepagents
    file's leading underscore signals it's not part of the public API.

    We copy the implementation here so a future upstream rename or
    semantic shift doesn't silently break thread reconstruction.
    Behavior MUST stay equivalent: dedups by message ``id``, tombstones
    via ``RemoveMessage``, resets on ``REMOVE_ALL_MESSAGES``. ID-less
    messages are appended without ID assignment — checkpointers
    serialize pending writes before ``update()`` runs, so IDs assigned
    inside the reducer never reach stored writes and would differ on
    replay, defeating deduplication.

    Raw dict / string / tuple inputs are coerced to typed ``BaseMessage``
    so HTTP-driven graphs (and persisted blobs that round-tripped
    through JSON) reconstruct correctly without a separate coercion
    step.

    ``state`` may be None on ``DeltaChannel.replay_writes`` for threads
    whose earliest checkpoint did not seed ``messages: []``, and is
    treated as the empty list.
